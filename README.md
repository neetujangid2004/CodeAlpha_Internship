# CodeAlpha_Internship
Intership project showcasing Python programming concepts, problem-solving, and real-world application development.

# 1. Hangman Game Assignment
The project demonstrates my understanding of Python programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and string manipulation.

-> Goal: 
Create a simple text-based Hangman game where the player guesses a word one letter at a time.

Simplified Scope:
●​ Use a small list of 5 predefined words (no need to use a file or API).
●​ Limit incorrect guesses to 6.
●​ Basic console input/output — no graphics or audio.

Key Concepts Used: random, while loop, if-else, strings, lists.
